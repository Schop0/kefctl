# kefctl - a command line application for controlling KEF speakers

  This application only requires Perl 5.10.1 or newer to be installed and has no
  other dependencies. So it should run pretty much everywhere without too much
  trouble, especially on Linux.

  To my knowledge there is no documentation about the KEF control protocol. So
  every feature in kefctl had to be reverse engineered by capturing network
  traffic generated by the KEF Control mobile application talking to **KEF LSX**
  speakers (Firmware version 4.1). Most features should also work fine with the
  **KEF LS50 Wireless**, but that has not been tested.

  Turning the KEF LS50 Wireless on might only work with the newer revision,
  serial number after LS50W13074K24L/R2G.

## Features

  * Turn speakers on and off
  * Change input source
  * Change volume
  * Mute and unmute speakers
  * Standby modes
  * Inverse L/R speakers
  * Check current speaker status

Usage: kefctl [OPTIONS]

    kefctl --status
    kefctl --volume 70
    kefctl --raise 5
    kefctl --lower 5
    kefctl --off
    kefctl -i optical
    kefctl -i bluetooth -S 20 -I
    kefctl -H 192.168.178.52 -p 50001 -i aux
    kefctl -r 5330819b0b

  Options:
    -h, --help                  Show this summary of available options
    -H, --host <host>           Speaker host, defaults to 192.168.178.52
    -i, --input <source>        Set input source to aux, bluetooth, optical,
                                usb or wifi
    -I, --inverse               Inverse L/R speakers, this option can only be
                                used together with the --input option
    -L, --lower <percentage>    Lower volume by X percent
    -m, --mute                  Mute speakers
    -o, --off                   Turn speakers off, the KEF LSX can be turned

    -r, --request <hex>         Send raw request in hex format and show response
                                (very useful for testing speaker features)
    -R, --raise <percentage>    Raise volume by X percent
    -s, --status                Show current speaker status
    -S, --standby <minutes>     Set standby time to 20, 60 or 0 (to turn standby
                                off), this option can only be used together with

    -u, --unmute                Unmute speakers
    -v, --volume <percentage>   Set volume to a percentage value of 0-100, be
                                aware that every input source has its own volume
